      %h4.course-title Refactoring in Rails
      %p.course-description
        %br
        In this hands-on workshop you will be presented with an actual Rails application ripe with code smells, tight coupling, leaky encapsulation, and missing abstractions. It’s much more than a code sample, written by a real team of developers under a deadline.

        %br
        Blog posts and books can make it look easy. “Here’s the synthetic example, now use X scripted transformation.” Unfortunately, codebases in the wild do not come with the right refactoring patterns hyperlinked.
        %br
        %br
        We will practice identifying issues, explore strategies to attack them, and put them into practice. This is not a walk-through of every refactoring in the cannon; this is practical application of great techniques. After this workshop you will be armed to attack your ownlegacy applications.

        I accidentally became a developer while pursuing a degree in molecular biology. I get a real kick out of finding ways of explaining technical subjects in simple terms. When programming, my focus is on automation, workflow optimization, and refactoring. Each week I have the great fortune to talk to smart and interesting people on the RubyRogues podcast.
